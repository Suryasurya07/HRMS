# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# HRMS
This is a full-stack HR Management System built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It streamlines HR processes like employee management, leave requests, and payroll management. The app provides an intuitive UI for HR admins and employees to manage profiles, leave requests, and more.
